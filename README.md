# Varyn -- Project Summary

## The Goal

Varyn is a modern, cloud-native statistical workspace built on R.

It is designed primarily for political analysts, econometrics students, and serious modelers who understand statistical software -- but find raw R too technical, messy, or intimidating.

---

## The Big Idea

There are powerful tools for modeling:

- Stata -- expensive and dated
- R -- powerful but overly technical for many users
- Notebooks -- flexible but messy and unstructured

Varyn bridges that gap.

It provides:

> A calm, structured statistical IDE for running serious models -- without the friction of raw R.

---

## Primary Audience

Varyn is built for:

- Political analysts
- Election modelers
- Econometrics students
- Public policy researchers
- Analysts who understand regression and modeling concepts
- Users who know what they want to run, but don't want to fight syntax or tooling

It is **not** designed for total beginners.
It is designed for capable users who want a better workspace.

---

## Core Vision

Varyn combines:

- The simplicity of Stata's workflow
- The power and flexibility of R
- The polish of modern SaaS tools (Linear / Cursor-level design)
- The scalability of cloud compute

It is:

- Cloud-first
- Workspace-based (not notebook-based)
- Structured around output cards, not console spam
- Progressive in complexity (simple when needed, advanced when desired)

## What Varyn Is

> A cloud-native statistical IDE built for modern political and economic modeling.

Or more simply:

> Run serious models. Beautifully.
